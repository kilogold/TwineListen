:: Start [spooky]
You ascend the creaking stairs to find yourself in a dimly lit attic. Dust motes dance in the thin beams of light filtering through the grimy windows. In the corner, an old man sits motionless in a weathered armchair.

[[Say nothing|Silence]]
[[Try to speak|Speak]]

:: Silence [spooky]
The old man shifts slightly in his chair, fabric whispering against fabric. His silence seems to hold weight, like a heavy blanket draped over the room.

<div class="dialogue">Minutes pass like molasses...</div>

[[Wait patiently|Wait]]
[[Clear your throat|Speak]]

:: Wait [spooky]
The dust continues to swirl in the air, catching what little light remains. The old man's breathing becomes more noticeable - slow, measured, deliberate.

<div class="dialogue">He finally speaks: "You have patience. That's... rare these days."</div>

[[Ask about his story|Story]]
[[Remain silent|EndingSilence]]

:: Speak [spooky dialogue]
The sound of your voice shatters the silence like glass. The old man flinches, his gnarled fingers trembling against the armrests.

<div class="dialogue">"Don't... don't test me..."</div>

[[Apologize|Apology]]
[[Insist gently|GentlyInsist]]

:: Apology [dialogue]
Your soft apology seems to settle in the air like the dust around you. The tension in the old man's shoulders eases slightly.

<div class="dialogue">"No need for apologies here. Sometimes... sometimes silence speaks volumes."</div>

[[Listen to his story|Story]]
[[Take your leave|End]]

:: GentlyInsist [dialogue]
You keep your voice soft, like speaking to a spooked animal. The old man's trembling subsides, replaced by a look of cautious interest.

<div class="dialogue">"Been a long time since anyone cared enough to insist..."</div>

[[Ask about the past|Story]]
[[Give him space|EndingSilence]]

:: Story [dialogue]
The old man leans forward, his eyes catching the light in a way that makes them seem to glow.

<div class="dialogue">"I've been waiting for someone who would listen... truly listen..."</div>

[[Continue listening|EndingStory]]

:: EndingSilence [spooky]
Sometimes the greatest understanding comes through shared silence. As you sit there in the dusty attic, you feel you've learned more than words could ever convey.

[[The End|End]]

:: EndingStory [dialogue]
His story unfolds like an old photograph album, each memory a faded image brought back to vivid life through his words. You leave the attic changed, carrying pieces of his tale with you.

[[The End|End]]

:: End [spooky]
The attic feels different now. Whether through words or silence, something has shifted in this dusty space between past and present.

<div class="dialogue">Thank you for listening.</div>
