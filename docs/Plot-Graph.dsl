// [Instructions/Guide]
// Summary:
// This Structurizr DSL C4 model is adapted for interactive narrative building. 
// It is unconventional, but works for rendering a story graph via Structurizr.
//
// Nomenclature:
// - Chapters (softwareSystem): ch_<chapter_slug>
// - Scenes (container): scn_<scene_slug>
// - Passages (component): pNN_<kind>_<slug> <display-name> <description> <status-effect> <tag>
//     - Naming convention:
//         - NN: two-digit sequence number (01, 02, ...)
//         - kind: rg | go
//             - rg: regular passage (tag "Passage")
//             - go: game over (tag "Passage-GameOver")
//     - Parameters:
//         - display-name: a short code (e.g., "P01"); second label is human-readable
//         - description: a short description of the passage.
//         - status-effect: Empty string ("") or comma-separated list of one-or-more NPC state variable increments/decrements. For example: "Stress +10, Anger +5".
//         - tag: a fully-qualified tag for the passage: "Passage" | "Passage-GameOver"
// - Cross-references: ch_<chapter>.scn_<scene>.pNN_<kind>_<slug>
// - Slugs: lowercase, snake_case, concise, 20 characters or less
//
// Relationships:
// - Treat directionality as plot continuity, as if answering "because..." into the next node.
// - Treat nodes with multiple afferent relationships as complimenting narrative, as if stating "and..." into the connected nodes.
// - Treat nodes with multiple efferent relationships as re-visiting the narrative topic with new information.
//      - Avoid infinite narrative recursion by ensuring that the narrative is always progressing.
