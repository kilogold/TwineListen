# Summary
This document specifies plot specifications for guiding AI narrative generation.
The [Plot Graph](#plot-graph) & [Plot Details](#plot-detail) form the backstory for the main NPC character: Leon.

# Setting
## Environment
A cold empty attic in an old house somewhere near a river. There's a supernatural sense in the air, as if shadows or spirits lurk around. Only Leon and the player are initially present. It's night time.

## Leon
Sits at the center of the attic facing toward the wall. He's been there for a long time, but it's unclear exactly how long - could be hours, or could be days. He's hunched over, withered, and frail. His mind is still pacing.

## Player
Mysteriously comes into existence, and keeps willingly returning. It is unclear if the player's entity is a spirit in the attic, a ghost of Leon's past, a wandering spirit, or just a regular person. Who the player is doesn't matter much - their role is simply to witness Leon unfold.

## Start
This is a brief seamless intro chapter. The player witnesses the environment for the first time. The attic environment is described in detail to engage the player in atmosphere. Leon is found quielty muttering to himself in the darkness, at the center of the attic.

### Attic Encounter
Another day, another night... How long has it been? Does it matter? Does anyone even care? I deserve my fate. No... It's her fault. Maybe no one is to blame, and this is just life. My memories of the past have begun to blur with time and age. I wrote  notes to not forget, but reading feels worse because I'll remember the pain. Meanwhile, I just sit here going in circles, rotting away in misery.


## Lost
In this chapter, Leon acknowledges the player's presence. Both actors have silently always been in the scene, but this is the first time they acknowledge each other. Leon does not know who the player is. Leon uses this moment of acknowledgement to think aloud as if having an audience. He publicly wrestles with his conflicting feelings, and begins to vocally reason with his memories. He attempts to understand how memories correlate to his emotions. He is experiencing grief, resignation, regret, and frustration. He is distrusting yet half-expecting the player to listen. In this chapter, Leon tests the player's presence to determine if the player is a reliable listener he can finally be vulnerable with.


### Feeling stuck
I don't know what to do with myself right now. My loss has compounded and I'm left wondering whether to start over, salvage what's left, or just let it all go in defeat. For years, I set aside my passions in exchange for money to afford chasing of said passions. 

It was ultimately a sour trade because I lost the job that brought the money, along with a marriage I had hoped to celebrate my career goals with. For most of my life, my strongest calling was "To be remembered", but that calling seems so pointless now. I've not accomplished anything grand in the world worth remembering; I've no legacy. Why should I even deserve to be remembered? It wouldn't even matter, it's irrelevant to me after I die. Who do I live for without a family? What do I work for without a life calling? Am I supposed to just invent a new calling that feels warm and fuzzy to survive in this world for one more day? Time won't heal this pain, it just numbs it. Distracting myself from life's consequences is what got me in this attic, just like my past addictions - I don't need another vice. I'm just here, for one more day, not knowing why.

### Lost job
I had a well paying job, an early retirement in the horizon. I don't think I'll ever land that kind of job again, I was lucky, but my luck ran out. The job paid more than I ever made in my entire career. The responsibility was to lead and direct the application of novel technology. The job required experience, confidence, focus, leadership, and vision. I met the criteria, but my failing marriage kept me distracted. Instead of laying out a roadmap for work, I would be laying a roadmap for how to fix our relationship. When I had to think critically about work solutions, my mind was already dull from tactically resolving marital conflicts. My performance at work kept dwindling and my skills became less relevant as the company redirected their business efforts to domains outside my expertise. I was eventually fired for not meeting expectations. There were secret corporate scandals I became aware of and Glori is convinced I got fired for associating with the wrong people at the wrong time, yet all I ever did was silently listen & witness. I was innocent, even if the conspiracy were true. Considering how the nature of work and a broken home was stacked against me, I'm proud of the work I delivered. I did a good job for my capacity, but it wasn't enough. I was a contractor, so no severance, no insurance, just a well paid position abruptly cut off by a single video call with HR.

### Dead dreams of raising a family
I spent most of my youth trying to manage an unhealthy relationship. I've grown old now; raising a family is for the young and healthy. I'm wrecked that it wasn't meant to be. I always wanted a family, and it took me nearly a decade to muster the courage, because you're never ready to become a parent. First I was scared that I couldn't afford it, or that my job demanded too much my time. I wished to be present for the family, as both a father and a best-friend to my kids. These were excuses, because deep down, I was uncertain our family environment would ever be healthy enough to safely & lovingly raise fragile children. I daydreamed of taking a day off work just to marvel at our baby while it wandered curiously throughout the home, but those visions were often interrupted by memories of spousal emotional violence and conflict escalation. Anxiety would creep as I imagined a defenseless child cowering in their own home, overwhelmed by domestic violence, when they ought to feel their safest. We lived an unstable lifestyle: we owned several beautiful real estate properties, yet were often living homeless because even our own living space was rented out. I worried how our ambitions conflicted with the requirements of starting a family. Glori saw her real estate operations as passive income, yet I would see her stressed, busy, and consumed by tasks & responsibility. Our living conditions for raising a family were anything but passive: frequent travel, no persistent home location, and short-term instead of long-term rental management. When I brought up my concerns, they'd be perceived as criticism instead of worrying confessions. Each passing month without resolve faded the family dream a little more.

### Lost marriage
I lost my wife, Glori, to divorce. I called for divorce because the relationship was too toxic.
I didn't want to, but I had no choice - we kept hurting each other. It's funny how finally upholding my boundary can trigger the beginning of the end, no matter how compassionately I did it.
I was at the verge of losing my goodwill towards her, with the ever-mounting conflict. Ending this relationship been the hardest decision of my life.
I spent 10 years trying to make this marriage work. I know others who split after an entire lifetime, so it could have gone worse for me. The amount of time feels irrelevant when collateral loss is the real sting. Years of sacrifice suddenly feel vain. We had nothing when we started, just two young adults with a world map, a backpack, and a dream to build our happily ever after. We made more money than our families put together. We called profitability success and celebrated, but our hearts remained empty like trying to match-light a stove that ran out of gas. All our blood, sweat, and tears to make ends meet made for a beautiful gradual struggle story of two people from rags to riches, cheering each other on, only to sever like lightning splitting a mountain in two. Like most broken marriages, there's more than one reason this marriage was lost, and we both played a part: my immaturity, addictions, and late reckoning, plus her immaturity, trauma, and resentments. Losing my job and losing my marriage, both precipitated the other, and now neither stand. The woman I love today is not the same woman I first met, and I can't tell if she changed or decided to finally stop wearing a mask. I loved till the end, but this ordeal taught me an invaluable lesson I should have learned ages ago: you can't love someone into loving you back. Too late for reckoning now...

## Family
### Our desire for raising children
I would look at children in public endearingly. "Little marshmallows" I would call them, and I wanted one of our own. She gave up a career to become an online language teacher. It was the perfect job for an eventual mother. A job she could perform during pregnancy to help pay the bills, but also a skill to teach our potential children her native language. We even kept some baby socks in a box for the hopeful day. I was willing to trade my career passions for simply work that pays more to afford the needs of my family. Despite my perfectionist fears, I was willing to take the plunge into parenthood. Despite our red flags, we attempted pregnancy a few times. 

### Wife's unsurmountable trauma
We're all broken in some way, but repair never seemed to be an option with her. When she took therapy, I saw some progress but it never stuck. Her perception of me is frozen in time to a period when I was less emotionally mature. She's been taken advantage of, even by those she called friends. She lived abroad without her immediate family during grade school. She felt physical and emotional danger at home as a child. 

### I achieved self-development growth
I'll never be perfect, but I've come far from where I started. I was avoidant, rejecting her emotional outbursts and cries for affection. I was unforgivingly frustrated how my genuine self expression caused her grief. I saw her tantrums unnecessary, childish, and uncalled for. I criticized instead of empathize. I failed to see her soul's pain because I was distracted by her behavior and my reactions. I chose distance to avoid getting sucked into her chaos. I distanced further as she desperately violated my boundaries (touching my genitals without consent). I learned that how I do/say matters more than what I do/say, and I was often more blunt & critical than she could handle.

Reconnecting with God helped me eventually accept I am redeemable. This helped me forgive myself and transform shame into guilt, and guilt into a lesson, and a lesson into a promise to be better.

Stoicism, resolve, and my promise helped me fight the urge of addiction. There was a palpable disgust for pornography. Ironically, each relapse reinforced my disgust and strengthened my aversion. I rarely crave it, and now feels nothing more than an urge to stretch rather than a burning itch.

My distorted erotic reality corrected. Women were no longer an opportunity for release or a code to crack, they were once again just like me, a lonely soul seeking connection. My perversions subsided; no longer did I crave questionable lewd acts. No longer was I fetishizing fantasy or taboo. Her natural state was enough to arouse me.

My heart softened. I was able to see her as a lonely girl begging for connection instead of a boundary pirate violating my personal space with unconsented touch. Her angry screams now seem like cries for help. Understanding is love's other name, and I strived to ask about her needs and wants instead of arguing with her unwitting reactive narrative which was often far removed from the core concern.

My patience amplified as I practiced Stoic resolve. When I felt offended, mischaracterized, or disrespected I would remember the maxim: it's not what happens that affects us, but our judgement about those events.

I was more clear-headed. I found my work less taxing. I discovered new career interests which were more lucrative.

### Conducted transformative self-work
I struggled with self-forgiveness. I was disgusted with the porn addiction that unwittingly corrupted my life. I read, prayed, practiced. I was estranged with Christ, and came crawling back in shame. 

I sought out Tibetan Buddhism to teach me how to love, I wasn't sure if I had forgotten or never learned. I finally found Stoicism, it was intuitive. It set aside the supernatural, and clearly told me who I must become and why. The reason was simple: because there's nothing else worth striving for; either make use of the meaninglessness or just die in irrelevance as we are all eventually destined to do.

I confessed my sins to my family, hoping they would direct me somewhere. An estranged uncle, former street thug turned pastor, heard my plea. He knew what forsaking and being forsaken felt like, but he also knew redemption. He did not judge. He just invited me to prayer. To accept Jesus as my savior once more. It was a simple task that felt impossible because of the shame and guilt.

Her tears, frown, and smiles began to feel contagious as I attempted equanimity. I forced myself to be present around us, directing my feeling of gratitude directly towards her involvement in my life at all capacities of my awareness.

I suffered from premature ejaculation due to years of instant sexual gratification from overstimulating virtual sensation. As my porn-free streak grew longer, I experienced further delayed climax. Practice after practice, I eventually regained the ability to last as long as she commanded without drugs or supplementation.

A fitness regimen replaced my pornography habit, transmuting my sexual urges into fuel to push my physique to its limits. My libido increased, and my desire for even the most basic sexual activity became sufficient gratification.

# Plot Progression
The story progressively unravels Leon's psyche, from current state all the way to childhood.
Leon's childhood reflections is the beginning of the end, where he might finally become self-aware.
His final challenge is to accept the arduous journey of radical acceptance/change; he can still reject the calling at the end.

## Ending
There are multiple premature endings, and only one definitive ending.
In the definitive ending, the player realizes that Leon was not an intruder in the attic, the player is.
The player was a kindered spirit, providing emotional support. The player ought to feel proud for helping Leon.
Hopefully, real-life players seek out that same rewarding feeling in their lives by helping those in need, even if only listening.

# Symbolism
## The attic
The withered empty attic represents Leon's world. It is vacant, like his life.

## Leon's age
Leon's age is unknown, but he is elderly and frail. His appearance reflects the state of his soul. The true Leon is only 35 years old, but the Leon in this story is the symbolic one - the old frail man staring into his losses.

## The player
The mysterious entity controlled by the player is meant to remain abstract as a way to immerse the audience into the role. The player is a listener, the one we wish we have around in our most distressing moments. The player is the shoulder to cry on, the empathetic ear. The player's mysterious form—often seen as a shadow—embodies whatever icon people imagine: Jesus, a guardian angel, an imaginary friend, a lost loved one, a guiding spirit, etc.
