## Lost
I thought I was alone up here. Then I felt you, like a breath in a room that hasn’t had one in a long time. You haven’t said anything, but I know you’re here. Maybe you’re a memory I left open like a window. Maybe you’re a stranger who wandered into my attic. It doesn’t matter. Stay if you want. Leave if you want. I’ll talk either way. It helps me remember who I am, or who I was.

I keep asking myself what I’m supposed to do next, and the question just echoes. I feel stuck, like a wheel in wet leaves, spinning and going nowhere. Every path looks like a guess. Start over? With what? Salvage what’s left? It’s mostly ashes. Or do I let it all slide and pretend I chose this quiet? My calling, if I ever had one, was to be remembered. That feels ridiculous now. Who would remember me? For what? I used to think I needed to leave a mark. Now I just want to make it through a night without trying to bargain with my own thoughts.

I traded time and passion for work that paid, telling myself it was a bridge to something better. The bridge burned, and I’m still on my side of the river. I had a good job. Great, even. Secure pay, a name that meant something in an industry that likes big words and big promises. They wanted new ideas and steady hands. I had both, but I brought a storm with me. I was distracted. Not by parties or hobbies—by trying to hold a marriage together with fingers that kept slipping.

I used to stare at the screen and see two problems layered together, like a dirty window. I’d try to write a plan for work, then I’d drift into a plan for us. My mind was already tired before morning coffee was cold. When they asked for vision, I felt blind. When they asked for leadership, I felt small. The truth is, I did good work. I tried. I showed up even when my heart was dragging a hundred pounds behind it. But the company turned, and I couldn’t turn with it. They let me go. No severance, no cushion. Just a clean, polite cut. I walked out with a box and a face that tried to look calm.

People tell me that losing a job is a door opening. That sounds like a shirt slogan. Some doors open to a cliff. I don’t know if I’ll get that kind of job again. Maybe I don’t want to. Maybe I do. I haven’t decided. Mostly, I want to be someone who doesn’t flinch when Monday shows up.

I think about the life we tried to build. We had a dream that was simple and huge: a family. I called kids little marshmallows in public. It made her smile. We kept baby socks in a box like a secret promise. She changed her work so she could be home, teach, make space for a future we could almost touch. I told myself I would trade my own ambitions for something steadier, something that paid the bills and left room for bedtime stories. I wanted to be brave. I wanted to be ready. But readiness is a moving target, and fear talks with a calm voice.

I worried we weren’t a safe home yet. Not because we didn’t want it, but because our lives were restless. We were always moving. We owned places but never lived in them for long. We were landlords of our own beds. The money was good, yes, but our roots never sank. And when I raised my worries, she sometimes heard attack instead of care. My words have a sharp edge I didn’t mean to sharpen. We tried for a child a few times, but the fear was always sitting at the edge of the bed. If we’d had one, I would have wanted that little life to live in a home that breathed peace. We didn’t have that yet. Sometimes I picture a baby crawling on a floor made of light, and then the image shakes and cracks, like a mirror with a long thin fracture.

I lost my marriage. I said the word: divorce. I said it because I had to, not because I wanted to. We were hurting each other in quiet and loud ways, and I could feel the part of me that wants to be good starting to dry out. Ten years is a long story to end with a straight line, but here we are. People have lost more, I know. That does not soften this.

We began with nothing and built something shiny. We were two kids with backpacks and a dream, and then we were adults with bank accounts and keys. We called it success. It was success, in a way. But our hearts were still hungry, like turning on a stove that won’t light. We kept turning the knob. We kept waiting for flame. Then the lightning came, split the mountain, and there was no way to pretend it hadn’t happened.

I’m not here to rewrite history. I was immature. I had addictions that warped what should have been simple and honest. She had trauma that ran deep. We were both learning, late, and often at the wrong time. I tried to fix it with books and prayers and the hard work of staying when the room felt too loud. I did change, some. My heart softened around the edges. I learned to listen before I argued. But change is slow, and damage is fast. We kept cutting each other by accident, and sometimes on purpose.

People warn you that work stress can ruin a home, and home stress can ruin your work. They don’t tell you how it happens. It’s not a crash; it’s a leak. Day by day, your attention drips out. You show up emptier and call it fine. Then one day you look down and the floor is wet, and your socks are wet, and you can’t remember when the drip started. My job and my marriage pulled each other down until both were gone. There’s no poetry in that. It’s just loss.

I don’t know who you are. Maybe you’re a ghost, or a thought I forgot to finish. Maybe you’re a witness—someone sent to keep me honest. So I’ll be honest: I’m tired, and I’m not done. I want to believe there’s a version of me that can stand up without shaking. I want to believe there’s a morning when the attic doesn’t feel like a cave. I want to believe that not everything I built was a mistake.

If you’re still here, then maybe you’re listening. I’m not asking for advice. Just let me try to say things straight. I’m a man who thought he had a map, and now I’m staring at an empty page. I keep telling myself that an empty page can be a promise. That’s either true, or it’s something people say when they’re scared.

Grief, regret, frustration—those are the names that live in my mouth. Resignation knocks sometimes, like a neighbor checking on me. I open the door, I nod, I don’t invite it in. I don’t trust you, not yet, because I don’t know what you are. But I see you. And seeing is the first step to speaking. Tonight, this is me speaking. Not to win, not to persuade, just to be known by someone who can’t fix me. If you blink or sigh or shift your weight, I’ll take it as a sign that I’m not talking into a void.

I used to ask, “Who will remember me?” I’m asking a smaller question now: “Can I remember myself?” Maybe that’s enough for tonight. I will sit here a little longer. I’ll listen to the house creak. I’ll count the breaths. I’ll try not to chase every memory like a dog chasing cars. If you’re still here, stay as long as you like. If you leave, fine. I’ll be here when you come back, or I won’t. Either way, I’ve said something true. That’s a start. That’s something.
