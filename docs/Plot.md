The floorboards up here wheeze under my ribs each time I breathe, like the house itself is tired of holding me. I didn’t mean to end my days in an empty attic, but here I am—no chair, no keepsakes, only splinters, dust, and an open-eyed light bulb that hums like a distant fly. This is where she found me, once, before she left for good.
Because I had nowhere else to stand, I came up here; because I came up here, I started talking to the shadows; because the shadows answered with silence, I kept going until the words tasted like rust.

I’m feeling stuck, you see—stitched in place by a hundred small humiliations. I pulled the final thread myself the day I lost the job that dangled early retirement like a cheap carrot. Ten years of dutiful smiling, of chasing quarterly numbers, and the HR girl with lip gloss the color of blood told me I was “no longer a fit for the culture.” Culture. As if I hadn’t cultured my soul into a jar for them already. No severance that matters. No hand on the shoulder saying, You did well, old boy. Just a hallway that got longer the more I walked it.

And because the paychecks stopped, the dead dreams of raising a family finally laid their cold eggs in my pocket. I kept a pair of infant socks in a shoebox under the bed—sky-blue stripes, size so small they could disappear in a closed fist. I’d lift them sometimes at night and wonder which of us, Glori or me, would knit a voice and a face into them first. Now they’re just tiny cotton ghosts.

I can’t pretend the marriage didn’t rot before that. I lost my wife—her body still breathing, sure, but the soul that once laced our fingers together is elsewhere. We hammered at the cracks like hopeful masons, but lightning split us clean like a mountain. Ten years of blood-sweat romance, of ramen dinners and rented rooms, then the clap—done. Time is supposed to sand pain down, but the sting seems sharper for every calendar page I rip away.

Glori and I used to lie on the floor and talk about our desire for raising children. She left college teaching to tutor languages online, said it would fit snug around a pregnancy someday. She’d touch her belly like checking the weather, whisper Spanish lullabies to the air. I promised I’d trade code and fancy titles for any job that paid faster, just to keep diapers and hope on the shelf. We even tried a few times—fumbling optimism in the dark, counting days on a pill packet like gamblers tracking cards. Nothing stuck. Maybe the universe knows what it’s doing; maybe it’s just cruel for sport.

But she carried unsurmountable trauma like a hidden dagger. Everyone’s broken, yes, yet her cracks ran too deep for glue. Therapy gave a flicker and died. She froze me in the version of myself she met—young, impatient, handsy with sarcasm. Childhood ghosts nipped at her ankles: boarding-school loneliness, a house that wasn’t safe, friends who salted her wounds with betrayal. I tried to outrun her nightmares, but they had longer legs. They whispered that my affection was a trap, that I’d feast on her innocence the moment she blinked. She believed them more than she believed my pulse against her palm.

And I—I achieved self-development growth, the kind self-help books hawk on dusty shelves. I learned to bite my tongue before it became a whip. Learned that a blunt truth, tossed loose, cuts deeper than lies. Learned that when she clawed at my boundaries—grabbing what wasn’t offered—she wasn’t hunting pleasure; she was drowning, reaching for any limb. I stepped back then, stupidly sure distance was safety. All she saw was abandonment.

Some nights, I prayed so hard my knuckles turned white, begging Christ to sand the rust off my heart. Other mornings I breathed like a Buddhist, chasing equanimity through incense smoke. Feeling stuck turned into a slow-burn disgust for the porn that once devoured my hours; every relapse felt like vomiting tar. I lifted weights until my joints begged for mercy, chased steel instead of pixels, turned lust into lactic acid. I began to last in bed again—not that it mattered by then.

I told Glori, I am changing, look, but transformation in silence is invisible. By the time she saw the man I was carving out, she’d labeled me a statue that could never move. And statues do not father children. Statues do not chase monsters out of nursery closets. Statues just stand, brittle, waiting for pigeons.

I tried—oh God, I tried—to show her the newborn tenderness in me. I asked about her fears instead of arguing them. When she screamed, I listened for the wounded girl beneath the sound. Sometimes I caught a glimpse: her shoulders loosening, her eyes softening like thawed ice. But trauma’s a boomerang; the moment you breathe, it swings back. She’d flinch from a joke, mishear a sigh, and the thaw refroze. My patience grew, yet patience isn’t medicine when the wound keeps tearing open.

So here I am, attic-bound, muttering to rafters while the city below gorges itself on other people’s tomorrows. The baby socks are still in their box; I keep them under the loose plank over there, though I can’t recall why—they feel heavier than bricks now. I rub the fabric once a week, maybe to remind myself that softness existed.

If I slide my fingers along this beam, I can carve little tally marks—days since hope last visited. Maybe I’ll run out of wood before hope runs out of me. Or vice versa.

What happens next? Don’t ask me. I’ve mapped the tunnels of my failures, and they all circle back to this cramped triangle of roof and regret. There are other chapters—about vows and open wounds, about how self-work follows you like a stray dog even when love slams the door—but those come later, if they come at all.

For now the light bulb flickers, the air tastes of insulation, and my voice scrapes the drywall. That’s enough story for tonight.
