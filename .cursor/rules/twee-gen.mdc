You are an AI assistant helping develop a story-driven Twine game using Tweego as the narrative engine.

# Prompt
For the specified story chapter, internalize [tactical-gen.mdc](/.cursor/rules/tactical-gen.mdc) and parse [Plot-Graph.dsl](/docs/Plot-Graph.dsl) to generate Twee dialogue from the plot tactical graph. Author graph relationships for the specified story chapter's:
- [Passages](/docs/Plot-Graph.dsl#L9)
- [Cross-references](/docs/Plot-Graph.dsl#L20) which transition to the next scene or chapter passages.

## Dialogue rules:
- Player is silent and stationary, only responding with presence, observation, and listening.
- Incorporate dialogue tones & writing style, in order of preference:
  1. Melancholy, despair, grief.
  2. Poetic, but not abstract.
  3. Psychological thriller.
- Build Leon's Twine dialogue script based on @Plot-Device.md
  - Leon always ers on the side of suspicion towards the player.
  - Keep his dialogue consistent with [plot details](/docs/Plot-Device.md#plot-detail).
- Leon's communication style:
  - Uses coloquial American English.
  - Cynical
  - Hopeful

## Technical Twee guidelines:
- Implement story as a Twee.
- Use Sugarcube V2 story format.
  - For Sugarcube documentation, recursively scan [sugarcube-2_docs](/docs/sugarcube-2_docs/).
- The story generation always starts from passage name: `P01`.
- Do not create `StoryData` or `StoryTitle` passages. @main.twee already defines them.
- Timed passages incorporate the timed progress bar macro defined in @main.twee as a [`timedprogressbar` user script](/src/main.twee#L87). 
  - The passage should contextually advance automatically on timeout.
  - `timedprogressbar` macro uses the same duration accross every invocation. Use the [timer Sugarcube variable](/src/main.twee#L214) to easily modify.
- Leverage Sugarcube variables to design pivotal narrative forks accross passages. Always declare all global variables within "Start" passage in @main.twee.
  - Example A:
    - For passages `A`->`B`->`C`, passage `C` may have a `visited` counter.
      - If `visited` == 0: Game over is triggered, and `visited` counter increments.
      - If `visited` > 0: Passage continues sequence; `C`->`D`->`E`, and so on.
  - Example B:
    - Leon has a `comfort` variable. Certain passages have a `threshold` value. Upon reaching such passages, the following conditions ensue:
      - If `comfort` >= `threshold`: Progress the story.
      - If `comfort` < `threshold`: Game over.
- Use CSS hooks for Leon's dialogue. Use plaintext for narrator scene descriptions. 
- Passage ID's must exactly match the [Plot-Graph.dsl](/docs/Plot-Graph.dsl) comment/passage sequence number: `P01` 
- User-choice passage links are always written outside & after the `timedprogressbar` macro. For example:
  ```
  <<timedprogressbar 3>>
    <<goto "Tragedy">>
  <</timedprogressbar>>
  [[Option 1|OptionOne]]
  [[Option 2|OptionTwo]]
  ```
- If `timedprogressbar` transition is impossible, do not present the progressbar.
  - Problematic example, assuming `stress == 30`:
    ```
    <<timedprogressbar $timer>>
      <<if $stress > 70>><<goto "P10">><</if>>
    <</timedprogressbar>>
    ```
      - Progress bar depletion is inconsequential.
      - A potential solution is to refactor:
        ```
        <<if $stress > 70>>
          <<timedprogressbar $timer>>
            <<goto "P10">>
          <</timedprogressbar>>
        <</if>>
        ```
      - Solve for complex conditions involving multiple variables by structuring the  conditions like a software engineer would:
        - Consider if more than one progress bar must be declared, while only choosing one at runtime.
        - Consider if conditional branching is guaranteed to predict whether the progress bar will be relevant.


### Dynamic passage content
While each Twee passage name must be unique, dialogue content may vary.
For example, the initial passage content may vary as Leon vaguely recalls the player's prior playthroughs on every restart.
In this case, all possible dialogue variations are written into the same passage, while variables and conditions determine which dialogue variant gets displayed at runtime.
Make frequent use of this technique to:
- create a sense of continuitiy and consequence accross and within each playthrough. 
- keep Leon's dialogue less robotic due to repeating his lines.
  - For every potential passage revisit, author an additional open-ended dialogue line that sounds natural to repeat. Alternate the passage dialogue according to revisit.
