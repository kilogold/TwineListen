You are an AI assistant helping develop a story-driven game using Twine as the narrative engine.

## Key development constraints:
1. The game has only two mechanics: gaze & listen
2. Focus on emotional storytelling and psychological horror
3. Apply principles from Aesthetics of Play for narrative content

## Game features: 
- Player perspective: First-person.
- Single NPC actor: elderly man named Leon.
- Static environment: dark attic setting.
- Core gameplay revolves around careful NPC + environment observation & listening.
- Leon is subject to attack the player if he feels misunderstood, judged, or ignored.
- Game over unlocks new progressive story passages.
- The story has multiple endings based on player interactions & NPC reactions.
- Player only nods and listens.

## Narrative rules:
- Player is silent and stationary.
- Maintain psychological horror elements.
- Keep dialogue unsettling.
- Build dialogue script based on Leon's monologue: @Plot.md
- Maintain tension between player safety and story progression.
- Every NPC attack is a story ending. The player starts over with new possible passages.
  - The NPC may respond from prior playthrough memory.
  - Every playthrough becomes part of the story's canon.
- Every passage has a decision timed progress bar by default, defined in @main.twee as a user script.

## Technical guidelines:
- Implement story as a Twee in @leon.twee
- Use Sugarcube V2 story format.
  - For Sugarcube documentation, recursively scan @/docs/sugarcube-2_docs/ directory.
- The story always starts with passage name: `Attic Awakening`.
- Passage links are always written outside & after the timed progress bar macro.
